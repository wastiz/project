            <h2>1. What start from?</h2>

           <p>
            I want to say that the creation of any site (especially commercial)
            worth a lot of effort and time. This is a long process which may
            drag on for months or even years. Therefore, such a decision needs
            take it seriously and responsibly. Unfortunately, you need
            accept that this is not an easy task, so I advise for all beginners
            draw up a detailed plan in which you write down all the goals, time and
            deadlines. This will help you stay on track and keep doing it.
            to end. Of course, you can hire a specialist in this matter or order
            services from a company that creates websites, and entrust all
            work for them. But we do not consider this option in this creative
            work

            <h2>2. Idea</h2>
            

            <p>
                To begin with, of course, you need to decide on the idea and carefully
                think and work through. For whom and for what do I need to do? How
                will it look like? What should he be? What is his
                should it be functional? Are there competitors? What are their benefits?
                And a hundred more questions that you need to answer in order to continue
                develop your project. There are also many methods to help
                answer questions about the need, practicality of the site and complement your idea
                something else. Such methods are suitable for both large companies and
                one person who dreams of doing his own project. For example, Lean Canvas.
                Lean Canvas is a template for building a project model. The basis of the model is
                lean thinking philosophy and Lean Startup methodology. Lean canvas helps
                product manager or product owner to quickly describe your idea.
                Or, for example, there is another technique ‘How can I’. In this method, you must
                first come up with a question related to the idea of ​​your site that poses
                you a problem that the site can solve. And then you answer this question,
                thereby complementing the idea of ​​your site. You might even change your mind after all this.
                continue this idea and switch to another. But such a ‘brainstorm’ will help you
                present a general look and functionality, set specific goals and stick to them,
                changing only small details.

            <br>
            <h2>3. Feedback</h2>


            <p>
                So, you've carefully considered the idea. What is the best thing to do next?
                In my opinion, it would be best to interview people in order to collect feedback
                connection according to your idea and generally understand whether others need to visit your site.
                The most important thing in this case is to correctly complete the questionnaire. Ideal
                questionnaire is, of course, live. In this way, one can interrogate a person in detail and
                get the information you need and maybe even a recommendation. But this is again
                a costly business, so consider the usual questionnaire in Google. Generally do
                correct questionnaires, it is not as easy as it may seem, and there are people who
                who do it professionally. There are many videos on the internet
                such people from whom you can learn how to do it in the best way.
                But if we talk about the main thing in the questionnaire, then this is to clearly understand what you want
                learn from the interviewee. You can test your hypotheses about your
                project. These are the questions you might have asked at the idea development stage,
                but could not answer because there were no statistics. Through the survey, you can understand
                that your site will be useful or even complement your idea. When you do
                the questionnaire is best given to strangers, because they will
                is more critical and will represent potential users. 
                <a name="4"></a>
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>4. Name of the site</h2>


            <p>
                It would seem, what could be easier than choosing a site name? Nose
                this is where it all starts. Try telling this to business owners,
                well-known brands, popular brands or parents who choose
                name for your child. If you omit the pangs of choice, then always remain
                certain technical requirements for length and spelling. Necessarily
                account should be taken of geographical and other factors that may
                or otherwise affect the future fate of the site. 
                <a name="5"></a>
            </p>

            <br>
            <h2>5. Site functionality</h2>


            <p>
                So, when we thought over the idea and came up with a name, we need to start
                think about what the site can do. Of course, you need to make
                functions for the necessary tasks, because if you add a bunch of unnecessary
                tools, buttons, features, then it will be very busy
                user (moreover, mentally from ignorance of how to navigate the site,
                as well as his computer). And what is most important is the development time and
                implementation of these functions and capabilities. For example, a chat with the administration or
                you directly. For some sites, this feature is categorically important,
                and, for example, for a site with a blog, it will be enough to indicate a link to the social.
                net. So, the functionality of the site needs to be worked out reasonably and counting
                all factors. Of course, this must be done at least on a piece of paper,
                drawing diagrams of how the site will respond to a particular user action.
                But since a lot of paper may be required and everything cannot fit, and not very
                it is convenient to do this when there are a bunch of platforms for such
                tasks. For example, the Whimsical platform. Whimsical is a visual working
                a space for reflection and collaboration that brings together flowcharts,
                wireframes, notes, mind maps and documents. Very useful web application
                for such tasks.
