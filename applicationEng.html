                        Also, while coding your own website design requires you to
                        more
                        effort than just using an existing ready-made template, at least you have

                        make sure you really want to look and not try to get around someone else's design.
                        A good feature of Dreamweaver is that it allows you to create responsive design, which
                        means that your site can be optimized for display on desktop computers, and
                        also
                        mobile devices without limiting users.
                        However, if you are a more advanced user, you may be happy to note that Dreamweaver
                        provides multi-monitor support for Windows. It also supports Chromium Embedded
                        Framework (CEF) for working with HTML5 and CSS elements. In addition, there is also support for Git,
                        allowing you to edit source code directly from Dreamweaver.
                        Dreamweaver is available as part of the Adobe Creative Applications Subscription Medium Package
